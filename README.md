# Human Activity Recognition

This repository contains Python code for performing **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. HAR involves classifying activities performed by humans based on sensor data, such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings. CNNs are a powerful deep learning architecture that can effectively learn spatial hierarchies from input data, making them suitable for sequence-based tasks like HAR.

## üöÄ Key Features:

- **Preprocessing:** Clean and extract features from sensor data to create input sequences for the CNN model.
- **Model Implementation:** Utilize TensorFlow/Keras to build and train a CNN model for activity recognition.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the trained model's performance using metrics such as loss and accuracy.
- **Scalability:** Adapt the code to accommodate various sensor data formats and activity recognition tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas

## üí° Usage:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Human_Activity_Recognition.git`
2. **Prepare Your Data:** Organize sensor data according to the expected input format.
3. **Configure Parameters:** Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in the provided code to fit your dataset and requirements.
4. **Train the Model:** Run the training script to train the CNN model with your prepared data.
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics and analysis.
6. **Iterate and Improve:** Fine-tune the model or experiment with different configurations to enhance performance if needed.
